# Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning:
In this resource, I will walk you through different Classification Algorithms in Machine learning, including:
1) Leveraging the Decision Tree Algorithm, I conducted an in-depth analysis of over 700 health records from India to predict the likelihood of individuals developing diabetes.

2) Support Vector Classifier: 
3) Logistic Regression
