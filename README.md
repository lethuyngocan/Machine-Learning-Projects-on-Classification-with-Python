# Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning:
In this resource, I will guide you through various projects where I employ diverse Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning to tackle a range of business problems. These include:

1) Leveraging the Decision Tree Algorithm, I conducted an in-depth analysis of over 700 health records from India to predict the likelihood of individuals developing diabetes.

3) By leveraging the Support Vector Classifier in conjunction with a Hyperparameter Method, I successfully classified various species of Iris flowers based on a dataset comprising 400 records encompassing the physical and biological properties of the flowers.[Link](https://github.com/lethuyngocan/Classification-Algorithms-All-you-need-to-know/blob/master/svm-feature-selection-and-hyper-parameter.ipynb)

4) By integrating the logistic regression model and the SMOTE model within a pipeline, I conducted an analysis of 284,806 transaction records from a credit company with the objective of detecting credit fraud.[Link](https://github.com/lethuyngocan/Classification-Algorithms-All-you-need-to-know/blob/master/fraud-prediction-smote-and-logistic-pipeline.ipynb)

5) In my analysis, I processed over 50,000 reviews from reviewers on the IMDB website. By transforming the textual data into numeric representations using text tokenization techniques, I then employed a combination of the SMOTE model and Logistic Regression within a pipeline to classify the movie reviews as either Negative or Positive comments.[Link]()
