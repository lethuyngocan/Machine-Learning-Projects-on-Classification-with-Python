# Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning:
In this resource, I will guide you through various projects where I employ diverse Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning to tackle a range of business problems. These include:

1) Leveraging the Decision Tree Algorithm, I conducted an in-depth analysis of over 700 health records from India to predict the likelihood of individuals developing diabetes.

2) By leveraging the Support Vector Classifier in conjunction with a Hyperparameter Method, I successfully classified various species of Iris flowers based on a dataset comprising 400 records encompassing the physical and biological properties of the flowers.

3) By integrating the logistic regression model and the SMOTE model within a pipeline, I conducted an analysis of 284,806 transaction records from a credit company with the objective of detecting credit fraud.

4) I analysed more than 50,000 reviews from TMDb movies and getting the answers to - Which actor(s) is associated with higher revenue and profit, Does a higher budget constitute to a higher profit, and Which director produced the highest grossing movie?
